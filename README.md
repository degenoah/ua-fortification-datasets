# Field Fortifications in Ukraine - Resources

This repository is for storing various datasets and 
other resources used in our field fortifications map.

## Included Datasets

- [Trenches](map_data/geojson/trenches_final.geojson)
- - Primary trenches. These are lines that are finished.
- [Trenches (Secondary)](map_data/geojson/treeline_trenches.geojson)
- - Secondary trenches. Usually used for roughly estimated / hard to see lines.
- [Trenches (Unfinished)](map_data/geojson/trenches.geojson)
- - Trench lines that need to be redrawn, not included in map.
- [Concealed Fortifications](map_data/geojson/concealed.geojson)
- - Polygons highlighting areas that are fortified in a concealed position.
    Mostly covering treelines near the front.
- [Anti-tank Obstacles (Ditches)](map_data/geojson/ditches.geojson)
- [Anti-tank Obstacles (Dragon's Teeth)](map_data/geojson/dragons_teeth.geojson)

## TODO

- Finish redrawing trenches and dragon's teeth along the Surovikin line.
- Clean up and include data from other mappers.
